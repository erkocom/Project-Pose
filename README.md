# Project-Pose

This project was contract-based work for a technopark firm and also served as my bachelor's degree thesis.

Detailed explanations and videos will be added soon.

Within this project, I:

-Developed 4 unique games that can be played using body movements through the camera, without the need for any additional devices, by leveraging deep learning networks.

-Managed all aspects of development, including game design, mechanics, user interface, optimization and deployment.

-Integrated real-time pose estimation deep learning model into Unity based games for gameplay control.

-Trained an RNN-based model for action recognition, achieving 97% accuracy, integrated it into games.

-Technologies used: C#, Unity, Python, TCP Communication, Deep Learning Models, Computer Vision, TensorFlow, Numpy, OpenCV.

Summary from my thesis:

In today's world, keyboards, mouse, and game controllers are the primary means of interacting with computers, gaming consoles, and similar devices. However, a more interactive experience often requires expensive and less accessible equipment such as virtual reality headsets and customized controllers.
This thesis project aims to offer a more interactive experience without the need for costly additional hardware. Four different games have been developed that allow users to interact using only a camera and their body movements.
Developed using the Unity game engine, these games leverage deep learning models for human pose estimation and action recognition to facilitate human-computer interaction. The developed games have been verified to run on devices with MacOS and Windows operating systems.
